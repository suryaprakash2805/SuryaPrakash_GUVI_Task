Problem Statement :

Create a signup page where a user can register and a login page to log in with the details provided during registration Successful login should redirect to a profile page which should contain additional details such as age, dob, contact, etc, The user can update.

Flow : Register > Login > Profile

Points to remember :

● HTML, JS, CSS, and PHP code should be in separate files none of the code must co-exist in the same file.
● Only use Jquery AJAX for interacting with the backend (strictly no usage of form submission).
● CSS can be used but the form must be designed in bootstrap in order to maintain page responsiveness.
● Use MySql for storing the registered data and MongoDB for Storing the details of the user profiles
● In MySQL always use Prepared Statements, with no usage of simple SQL statements.
● The login session should be maintained only using browser localstorage (Do not use PHP Session)
● Use Redis to store the session information in the backend.
